# Jamie Wilkie's Advent of Code - 2023

This is the Advent of Code challenge 2023, which can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

This activity is a great way to learn how to apply programming related concepts in a fun daily coding challenge.

Each daily challenge has a folder in this repo.  Within the folder, there are .txt files with the test data provided and my actual problem input (generated uniquely for each participant by the challenge).

The code repository was pre-populated using [createstructure.py](createStructure.py).

I'm initially writing this in python (written in Spyder), but may return to attempt other languages (or even Excel) at a later date.

More information about myself and Training the Street's data science offerings can be found [here](https://trainingthestreet.com/).
